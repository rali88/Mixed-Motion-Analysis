# MATLAB program to analyse motion of particles that exhibit motion with multiple components  
   
## MS Thesis   
    
This analysis was part of my MS thesis. It was successfully completed and the result is a MATLAB program called [MixMAs](https://github.com/rali88/Mixed-Motion-Analysis/blob/master/Mixed%20Motion%20Analysis.mlappinstall). The thesis is published and can be accessed from this [link](https://github.com/rali88/Mixed-Motion-Analysis/blob/master/Thesis.pdf).   
   
   
## Need for this analysis and the goals of this analysis   

•	Proteins in neurons are transported from the cell body to the axon terminal.    
   
•	In layman's term it is just like any other kind of transport from one point to another.   
    
•	The transport is carried out by motor proteins. An analogy of this is a mail man who walks from the post office to your house.   

•	The motion of motor protein has multiple components: directed, static and diffusive. Again, imagine the mail man moving in a certain direction (directed), stopping to get some rest (static) and then forgetting his way and moving in random directions (diffusive).   

•	The goal of this project was to automate the analysis of motion data of proteins in general (motor proteins in specific) in an objective, time efficient and user-friendly manner.
